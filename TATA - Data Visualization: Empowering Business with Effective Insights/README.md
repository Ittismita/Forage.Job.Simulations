## Task 1:
### Framing the Business Scenario:

***Situation*** : 

An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.

The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on whatâ€™s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

A meeting with the CEO and CMO has been scheduled for next month and you need to draft the relevant analytics and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on expansion.

***Task*** : 

To draft questions that you think will be important and relevant to the CEO and CMO.

***Action*** :

To frame relevant and differentiable questions important for the CEO and CMO.

***Result*** :

Questions that may be important for the CEO:
1. What is the revenue generated by each country or region?
2. What is the revenue generated on a monthly basis?
3. Which customers led to greater revenue generation? Is the business dependent on these customers or is the customer base diversified?

Questions that may be important to the CMO:
1. What percentage of customers are repeat buyers?
2. Who are the customers that have repeated the most? How much are they contributing to revenue?
3. Which products are sold the most?
4. What revenue is being generated from the customers who have ordered more than once?
 
***Learnings*** :

1. To think from the perspective of business leaders to analyse data more effectively.
2. To prepare for a meeting with senior leaders.

## Task 2:
### Choosing the right visuals:

***Situation*** :

You have been asked by the CEO and CMO to provide visuals on the metrics that they wish to analyse for the online retail store. You will gather the requirements and provide them with the type of visual that would be best suited to the scenario. The senior management wants to understand how their business is performing and what areas are the key strengths of the company. They are also focused on identifying opportunities that would lead to growth and generate more revenue in the future.

***Task*** :

Understand that business requirement. Once you have an idea of what is required from the perspective of the CEO and CMO, come up with the perfect visual which will illustrate what the senior managers are looking for in each scenario.

***Action*** :

Data Cleanup:
1. Filtering the data to include only the records with:
   
   a. Unit Price >= $0
   
   b. Quantity >= 1

Choosing the right visuals for the below scenarios:
1. The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the entire year. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.
   
The visual chosen: Line Chart

2. The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, as a subcomponent, they would also like to see which products are contributing to the total revenue being generated by each country.
   
The visual chosen: Stacked Bar Chart

3. The CEO of the online retail store wants to see how much average revenue is generated by each country. They are interested in viewing the following metrics on the visual: Minimum value First quartile value Median value Third quartile value Maximum value.
   
The visual chosen: Stacked Bar Chart: Box Plot

4. The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. They are interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue-generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue-generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue-generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.
   
The visual chosen: Column Chart

5. The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. They want to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, they will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand.
   
The visual chosen: Map Chart

## Task 3:
### Presenting findings to the CMO and CEO:

Process:
1. Loaded Data into Tableau.
2. Used Data Source Filter to exclude data points that do not match the prevously mentioned conditions.
3. Chose the correct visuals that would depict the findings efficiently.

Findings:
1. The revenue in the first 8 months is fairly constant as the average revenue generated for these 8 months is around $685k. The increase in revenue starts in the month of September, where the revenue increases by 40% over the previous month. This trend continues till the month of November where it reached 1.5 million USD, the highest during the entire year. The data is incomplete for the month of December, therefore, no conclusion can be drawn from it, unfortunately. This analysis shows that the retail store sales are impacted by the seasonality which usually occurs in the last 4 months of the year.
2. Leaving out U.K. as the country already has high demand, the other countries / regions which have bought high volumes of units and generated high revenue were Netherlands, followed by EIRE(Ireland), Germany and France. 
3. The data shows that there is not much of a difference between the purchases made by the top 10 customers. The highest revenue generating customer only purchased 17% more than the 2nd highest which shows that the business is not relying only on a few customers to generate the revenue.
4. The map chart shows the regions that have generated the most revenue compared with the regions that have not. It can be seen that apart from the UK, countries such as Netherlands,Ireland, Germany, France and Australia are generating high revenue and the company should invest more in these areas to increase demand for products. The map also shows that most of the sales are only in the European region with very few in the American region. Africa and Asia do not have any demand for the products, along with Russia. A new strategy targeting these areas has the potential to boost sales revenues and profitability.
