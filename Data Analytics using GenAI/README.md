## Data Analytics using GenAI

#### Scenario
As an AI transformation consultant, have been tasked with helping Geldium Finance, a financial services company, reduce its high credit card delinquency rate by performing advanced analytics and building AI/ML models with the assistance of GenAI. 

Geldium, a financial services provider specializing in digital lending and consumer credit, has observed an increase in credit card delinquency rates, with more customers missing payments beyond the 30-day late payment threshold. To improve risk management and customer engagement, they have engaged Tata iQ(us) to develop an AI-powered predictive solution that helps identify at-risk customers and recommend appropriate interventions.

The head of Geldiumâ€™s Collections team wants to improve how they assess repayment risk and prioritize outreach efforts. Currently, their approach relies on historical trends and manual case handling, which limits efficiency. 

They are looking for a solution that can:
1. Use AI-driven insights to help predict which customers are likely to miss payments.
2. Support the Head of Collections with targeted intervention strategies to reduce delinquency.
3. Ensure fairness and transparency in AI-driven risk assessments while aligning with industry practices.

#### Task
1. EDA, risk profiling and quality assessment:
   1. Identify key datasets required to predict delinquency. 
   2. Perform an exploratory analysis on provided datasets, using GenAI tools to assist with summarization, treatment of missing data, risk profiling, and synthetic data creation. 
   3. Document your findings, including data patterns and anomalies that may impact predictions.

   Ensure completeness, flag potential gaps and identify patterns in the datasets.
