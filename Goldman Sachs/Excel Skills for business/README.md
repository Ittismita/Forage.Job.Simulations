To build out forecast assumptions based on the information from the client contained within the file. The operating assumptions are split out between Revenue, Costs, Cash Flow and Other.

## TASK3.xlsx
Armed with a completed set of forecast assumptions, we now turn our attention to producing a forecast profit and loss (P&L) statement. This financial statement shows a companyâ€™s profit or loss over a particular period (typically a financial year).
